# Plugin for Diagrams.net

This plugin is modified from `tags.js` in [offical repo](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio/tree/dev/src/main/webapp/plugins).

## Current Issues
- The Zotero API can not be imported by the plugin, which is an UMD module released by [Zotero Javascript API](https://github.com/tnajdek/zotero-api-client).
