# Research Helper

This is a front-end only web tool which retrieves library from your [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) personal account and organize your references according to its collection. The outputs can be used to generate `tags` in [diagrams.net](http://diagrams.net/), which allow one to make citations with unique hash key.

## Quick start
1. Register a private API key from [here](https://www.zotero.org/settings/keys/new).
2. Lookup for your userID from [here](https://www.zotero.org/settings/keys).
3. Follow the steps in [this](https://github.com/sciyen/ResearchHelper/plugins) to permanently add a plugin to your diagrams.
4. Obtain the tags with [our tool](https://sciyen.github.io/ResearchHelper/public/index.html) and copy to clipboard.
5. Select a block, and add a tag from `Tags` dialog in your diagram.
6. And you should see the attached yellow block with standard citation.
